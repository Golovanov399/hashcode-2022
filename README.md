# Hashcode 2022

This is a `pygame` interactive version of the Hashcode 2022 finals. It requires `pygame` and probably something else.

## Usage:

`./game.py <test>`, where `<test>` is a letter, for example, `./game.py c`.

## Controls:

- arrows for accelerating,
- `r` for restarting the level,
- `z` for `Ctrl+Z` (also undoes `r`),
- `s` for saving current progress into a submission,
- `p` to deliver all gifts within the current radius, having picked them last time we were near the base,
- `c` to pick up a carrot last time we were near the base.
